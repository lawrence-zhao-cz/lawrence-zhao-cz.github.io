Welcome!

I am a Finance Ph.D. candidate at the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University.

My research interests include empirical corporate finance, household finance, competition, and financial intermediation. 

I will be joining the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech University as an Assistant Professor of Finance in 2023.
