Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech University.

My research interests include empirical corporate finance, household finance, competition, and financial intermediation. 

Prior to joining Texas Tech University, I earned a B.B.A. in Finance and Mathematics and an M.S. in Economics from Baylor University, and a Ph.D. in Finance from Rice University.
