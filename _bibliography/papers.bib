  title={The Real Effects of Antitrust Enforcement on Corporate Decisions: Evidence from the Courts},
  author={Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={I investigate the real effects of antitrust policies on corporate acquisitions, investment, and innovation. I use plausibly exogenous variations in judges' propensity to dismiss antitrust cases as an instrument for endogenous exposure to antitrust enforcement. The evidence indicates that antitrust enforcement imposes behavioral constraints on firms. Specifically, defendant firms that go through antitrust litigation experience a significant decrease in future acquisitions, especially among serial acquirers. The adverse effect is economically large but transitory, disappearing after two years. Defendant firms substitute acquisitions with internal investment, resulting in no change in patent outputs. My findings highlight the importance of vigorous and continuous antitrust enforcement.},

  title={Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Search Frictions and Financial Adviser Misconduct},
  author={Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={I examine the impact of FINRA's national advertising campaign promoting BrokerCheck, a free online tool that discloses disciplinary actions against financial advisers. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I demonstrate that the campaign increased clients' awareness of their advisers' past misconduct records. As a result, exposed advisers experienced a significant 9\% abnormal decrease in assets under management. Advisers who primarily served less sophisticated clients experienced more severe adverse effects. Clients switched to advisers with clean records. In response, advisers increasingly disciplined employees who engaged in misconduct. These findings highlight the importance of addressing search frictions in combating financial adviser misconduct and improving market efficiency.},
