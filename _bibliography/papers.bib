  title={The Real Effects of Antitrust Enforcement on Corporate Decisions: Evidence from the Courts},
  author={Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={I investigate the real effects of antitrust policies on corporate acquisitions, investment, and innovation. I use plausibly exogenous variations in judges' propensity to dismiss antitrust cases as an instrument for endogenous exposure to antitrust enforcement. The evidence indicates that antitrust enforcement imposes behavioral constraints on firms. Specifically, defendant firms that go through antitrust litigation experience a significant decrease in future acquisitions, especially among serial acquirers. The adverse effect is economically large but transitory, disappearing after two years. Defendant firms substitute acquisitions with internal investment, resulting in no change in patent outputs. My findings highlight the importance of vigorous and continuous antitrust enforcement.},

  title={Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Search Frictions and Financial Adviser Misconduct},
  author={Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={The misconduct records of financial advisers are public information, yet advisers that persistently engage in misconduct survive in the market. Past literature attributes this phenomenon to market segmentation caused by search frictions associated with client sophistication. I investigate this hypothesis by examining FINRAâ€™s unprecedented advertising campaign promoting BrokerCheck. Exposed advisers sustain a 9\% abnormal decrease in assets under management. Advisers that primarily serve less sophisticated clients experience more severe adverse effects. Clients switch to advisers with clean records. Advisers increasingly discipline employees who engage in misconduct. My findings highlight the importance of resolving search frictions in fighting financial adviser misconduct.},
