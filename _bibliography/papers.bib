  title={The Real Effects of Antitrust Enforcement on Corporate Decisions: Evidence from the Courts},
  author={Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={I investigate the real effects of antitrust policies on corporate acquisitions, investment, and innovation. I use plausibly exogenous variations in judges' propensity to dismiss antitrust cases as an instrument for endogenous exposure to antitrust enforcement. The evidence indicates that antitrust enforcement imposes behavioral constraints on firms. Specifically, defendant firms that go through antitrust litigation experience a significant decrease in future acquisitions, especially among serial acquirers. The adverse effect is economically large but transitory, disappearing after two years. Defendant firms substitute acquisitions with internal investment, resulting in no change in patent outputs. My findings highlight the importance of vigorous and continuous antitrust enforcement.},

  title={Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Search Frictions and Financial Adviser Misconduct},
  author={Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={The misconduct records of financial advisers are public information, yet advisers that persistently engage in misconduct survive in the market. Past literature attributes this phenomenon to market segmentation caused by search frictions associated with client sophistication. I investigate this hypothesis by examining FINRA’s unprecedented advertising campaign promoting BrokerCheck. Exposed advisers sustain a 9\% abnormal decrease in assets under management. Advisers that primarily serve less sophisticated clients experience more severe adverse effects. Clients switch to advisers with clean records. Advisers increasingly discipline employees who engage in misconduct. My findings highlight the importance of resolving search frictions in fighting financial adviser misconduct.},

  title={Throwing Banks out with the Bathwater: Fraud Litigation and FHA Mortgage Lending},
  author={Erik Mayer and Billy Xu and Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={We study the impact of recent increases in mortgage lenders’ litigation risk on borrowers. In the last decade, the U.S. Department of Justice brought suits against many of the largest lenders in the FHA mortgage market, alleging fraud under the False Claims Act. These suits led to over \$5.3 Billion in settlements and caused targeted banks and their peers to precipitously exit the FHA market. A combination of difference-in-differences and triple differences tests exploiting geographic variations in exposure to exiting banks show a 19\% reduction in aggregate FHA lending in heavily affected areas. Smaller non-bank lenders with higher historical misconduct rates partially filled the void in the FHA market, highlighting the potential unintended consequences of aggressive consumer financial protection litigation.},
