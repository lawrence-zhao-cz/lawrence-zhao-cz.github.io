  title={The Real Impact of Antitrust Litigation on Corporate Decisions: Evidence from the Courts},
  author={Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={I investigate the real impact of antitrust litigation on corporate acquisitions, investment, and innovation. I exploit the random assignment of judges and use the variations in judge propensity to dismiss antitrust cases as an instrument for endogenous litigation outcomes. Defendant firms that go through antitrust litigation experience a 31.4-percentage-point decrease in the likelihood of future acquisitions. The adverse effect is economically large but transient, disappearing after two years. Firms substitute acquisitions with internal investment. Despite the higher costs of in-house R\&D, there is no evidence that antitrust enforcement hinders the defendants' access to innovation.},

  title={Financial Adviser Misconduct, Intervention, and Investor Behavior},
  author={Lawrence Zhao},
  abstract={Financial education interventions are of great interest to policymakers, yet past studies find these interventions expensive and ineffective, particularly among retail customers. I examine FINRAâ€™s unprecedented advertising campaign promoting BrokerCheck and document its economically significant impact on investors and registered investment advisers (RIA). Advisers with past misconduct sustain a 9\% abnormal decrease in assets under management. Investors switch to advisers with clean records. Advisers increasingly discipline employees who engage in misconduct. My findings suggest that even simple information provision can have large economic impacts and enhance investor welfare.},
